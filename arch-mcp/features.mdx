# Core Features

Arch MCP Server provides three types of capabilities that work together to enable intelligent interaction with the Arch Linux ecosystem.

## üîç Resources

URI-based access to Arch ecosystem data - read documentation, package info, and system state.

  **5 URI schemes** for accessing Arch Wiki, AUR packages, official repos, and installed packages

  />
</Frame>

**What you can do:**
- Access Arch Wiki pages in Markdown format
- Fetch PKGBUILD files with safety annotations
- Query AUR package metadata
- Look up official repository packages
- List installed packages (Arch only)

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools

Executable functions for search, security analysis, and package installation.

>
  **8 tools** including search, security analysis, system checks, and secure installation
</Card>

    style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }}
  />
</Frame>

**What you can do:**
- Search Arch Wiki and AUR packages
- Analyze PKGBUILD files for security risks
- Evaluate package trustworthiness
- Check for system updates safely
- Install packages with automated security checks

## üìã Prompts

Guided multi-step workflows that combine resources and tools for complex tasks.

  **3 intelligent workflows** for troubleshooting, security audits, and dependency analysis
</Card>

    style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }}
  />
</Frame>

**What you can do:**
- Diagnose system issues with Wiki-guided solutions
- Audit AUR packages before installation
- Plan installations by analyzing dependencies

## How They Work Together

**Example: Installing a Custom AUR Package**

Let's say you want to install `neofetch` from the AUR. Here's how the MCP components work together:

```
You: "I want to install neofetch from AUR, but I'm concerned about security"

1. The system uses aur://neofetch/pkgbuild to fetch the PKGBUILD file
   ‚Üì This gives you the raw build script to inspect

2. The analyze_pkgbuild_safety tool scans the PKGBUILD for:
   - Dangerous commands like "rm -rf /"
   - Suspicious downloads or network activity
   - Obfuscated code or potential malware

3. Meanwhile, aur://neofetch/info provides package metadata:
   - Popularity votes and maintainer info
   - Last update date and package age
   - Community trust indicators

4. The analyze_package_metadata_risk tool evaluates:
   - Is the maintainer trustworthy?
   - How popular is this package?
   - When was it last updated?

5. If everything checks out, install_package_secure handles the installation
   with additional safety checks and confirmation prompts
```

This natural workflow lets you safely explore and install AUR packages while understanding exactly what you're getting into.

## Quick Reference

| Type | Count | Access Method | Use Case |
