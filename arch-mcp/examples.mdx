# Try Examples

Test the Arch MCP Server with these common use cases.

## Search Examples

### Search Arch Wiki

```
Search the Arch Wiki for 'installation guide'
```

Uses the `search_archwiki` tool to find relevant documentation.

### Search AUR

```
Search AUR for 'yay'
```

Uses the `search_aur` tool with safety warnings automatically included.

## Resource Examples

### Read Wiki Page

```
What's in the Installation_guide Wiki page?
```

Reads `archwiki://Installation_guide` resource directly.

### Get PKGBUILD

```
Show me the PKGBUILD for the 'yay' package
```

Fetches `aur://yay/pkgbuild` with raw content.

## Package Info Examples

### Official Package

```
Get info about the 'python' package
```

Uses `get_official_package_info` tool for official repository packages.

### AUR Package Info

```
Show detailed information about the 'heynote' AUR package
```

Gets metadata including votes, maintainer, age, and status.

## Security Examples

### Audit AUR Package

```
Audit the AUR package 'yay' for safety
```

Uses the `audit_aur_package` prompt to:
1. Fetch package metadata
2. Analyze PKGBUILD for threats
3. Provide security recommendations

### Analyze PKGBUILD

```
Analyze this PKGBUILD for security issues: [paste PKGBUILD content]
```

Uses the `analyze_pkgbuild_safety` tool to detect malicious patterns.

## System Examples (Arch Linux only)

### Check Updates

```
Check what system updates are available
```

Uses `check_updates_dry_run` tool (read-only, safe operation).

### Analyze Dependencies

```
Analyze dependencies for installing 'docker'
```

Uses the `analyze_dependencies` prompt workflow.

## Advanced Examples

### Compare Packages

```
Compare the 'vim' package between official repos and AUR
```

Combines multiple tools for comprehensive comparison.

### Find Alternatives

```
I want to install 'nginx'. Search Arch Wiki for best practices and find alternatives in the AUR
```

Combines wiki search, official packages, and AUR search.

### Security Review Workflow

```
Run a complete security audit for installing 'syncthing':
1. Get official package info
2. Check AUR alternatives
3. Analyze PKGBUILDs for security
4. Show comparison
```

Multi-step workflow combining tools and resources.

## Troubleshooting

<Accordion title="Tool not working?">
1. Verify uvx installation: `uvx --version`
2. Restart your MCP client (Claude Desktop, Cursor, etc.)
3. Verify arch-ops appears in connected MCP servers
4. Check logs in your client for specific errors
5. Try reinstalling: `uvx --reinstall arch-ops-server`
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Getting timeout errors?">
1. Check internet connection
2. Try a simpler query first
3. Verify Arch Wiki and AUR are accessible
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="AUR search returns no results?">
The package might not exist, or the AUR might be temporarily unavailable. Try:
- Double-check package name spelling
- Search for similar names
- Try a few minutes later
</Accordion>
