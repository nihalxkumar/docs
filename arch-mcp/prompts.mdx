# Prompts (Guided Workflows)

Pre-configured multi-step workflows that combine resources, tools, and AI reasoning to accomplish complex tasks efficiently.

## What are Prompts?

Prompts are intelligent workflows that:
- Guide you through multi-step processes
- Combine multiple tools automatically
- Provide context-aware recommendations
- Leverage AI reasoning for better results

Unlike individual tools, prompts orchestrate multiple operations and make intelligent decisions based on intermediate results.

## Available Prompts

### troubleshoot_issue

Diagnose and resolve system errors using Arch Wiki knowledge.

**Purpose:** Help users identify and fix system problems by leveraging Wiki documentation and AI analysis.

**Workflow:**
1. Extract keywords from error description
2. Search Arch Wiki for relevant documentation
3. Analyze error context
4. Provide context-aware suggestions
5. Link to detailed Wiki sections

**When to use:**
- System errors or failures
- Service/daemon issues  
- Boot problems
- Configuration errors
- Package conflicts

**Example Input:**
```
"Help! My computer won't start up, it's just showing a grub rescue prompt and I don't know what to do"
```

**Example Output:**
- Extracted keywords: "boot", "grub", "rescue"
- Wiki pages: GRUB, Boot process, System rescue
- Diagnostic steps
- Recovery commands
- Prevention tips

**What it does:**
1. Parses your error description
2. Identifies key technical terms
3. Searches multiple Wiki pages
4. Prioritizes most relevant sections
5. Provides step-by-step solutions
6. Links to additional resources

### audit_aur_package

Perform comprehensive pre-installation security audit for AUR packages.

**Purpose:** Evaluate package safety before installation by analyzing metadata, PKGBUILD, and trust indicators.

**Workflow:**
1. Fetch AUR package metadata
2. Analyze package metadata risk
3. Retrieve and analyze PKGBUILD
4. Check for malicious patterns
5. Evaluate maintainer reputation
6. Generate security recommendations

**When to use:**
- Before installing any AUR package
- Investigating suspicious packages
- Security audits
- Verifying package safety

**Example Input:**
```
"I want to install yay but I'm worried about security, can you check if it's safe?"
```

**Example Output:**
- Package info (votes: 2500+, popularity: high)
- Metadata risk: LOW
- PKGBUILD analysis: No suspicious patterns
- Maintainer: Known contributor
- Recommendation: SAFE TO INSTALL

**Security Checks:**
- ✓ Vote count validation
- ✓ Maintainer verification  
- ✓ Package age check
- ✓ Update frequency analysis
- ✓ PKGBUILD pattern scanning
- ✓ Dependency safety

**What it provides:**
1. Overall risk assessment
2. Detailed security findings
3. Line-by-line PKGBUILD analysis
4. Trust indicators
5. Installation recommendation
6. Alternative suggestions (if risky)

### analyze_dependencies

Plan package installation by mapping dependencies and determining optimal install order.

**Purpose:** Understand package dependencies and create installation plan for complex setups.

**Workflow:**
1. Query official repositories
2. Search AUR if needed
3. Map dependency tree
4. Check for conflicts
5. Suggest installation order
6. Identify optional vs required deps

**When to use:**
- Installing packages with many dependencies
- Resolving dependency conflicts
- Planning complex installations
- Understanding package relationships

**Example Input:**
```
"I'm trying to set up Docker for my development work, what packages do I need to install?"
```

**Example Output:**
- Repository: extra
- Required dependencies: containerd, runc, bridge-utils
- Optional dependencies: docker-compose, docker-buildx
- Conflicts: None
- Install order: 
  1. containerd
  2. runc  
  3. bridge-utils
  4. docker
  5. docker-compose (optional)

**What it analyzes:**
1. Direct dependencies
2. Transitive dependencies
3. Conflicts and replaces
4. Optional dependencies
5. Make dependencies (AUR)
6. Check dependencies (AUR)

**Installation Planning:**
- Groups packages by type
- Orders by dependency chain
- Flags potential conflicts
- Highlights optional features
- Suggests pre-installation steps

## Prompt Usage Patterns

### Troubleshooting Pattern
```
User: "I'm trying to start nginx but it keeps saying permission denied, what's going wrong?"
AI (using troubleshoot_issue):
  → Searches Wiki: "nginx", "systemd", "permissions"
  → Finds relevant sections
  → Provides diagnostic commands
  → Suggests fixes with explanations
```

### Security Audit Pattern
```
User: "I found this package called 'crypto-miner-helper' on AUR, should I trust it?"
AI (using audit_aur_package):
  → Fetches metadata (votes, maintainer, age)
  → Analyzes PKGBUILD for malicious code
  → Checks maintainer reputation
  → Provides risk assessment
  → Recommends action
```

### Dependency Analysis Pattern
```
User: "I want to set up a development environment with Docker, what all do I need to install?"
AI (using analyze_dependencies):
  → Checks official repos first
  → Maps dependency tree
  → Identifies optional features
  → Suggests install order
  → Warns about conflicts
```

## Combining Prompts

Prompts can be chained for complex workflows:

**Example: Safe AUR Installation**
```
1. audit_aur_package → Check if package is safe
2. analyze_dependencies → Plan installation
3. (Manual) install_package_secure → Execute install
```

**Example: System Issue Resolution**
```
1. troubleshoot_issue → Diagnose problem
2. search_archwiki → Get detailed docs
3. (Manual) Apply suggested fix
4. troubleshoot_issue → Verify resolution
```

## Prompt vs Tool vs Resource

| Type | Purpose | Interaction | Examples |
|------|---------|-------------|----------|
| **Resource** | Read data | Passive lookup | `archwiki://`, `aur://*/info` |
| **Tool** | Single operation | Execute function | `search_aur`, `analyze_pkgbuild_safety` |
| **Prompt** | Multi-step workflow | Guided process | `troubleshoot_issue`, `audit_aur_package` |

**When to use each:**
- **Resource**: Direct data access, you know exact location
- **Tool**: Single specific operation needed
- **Prompt**: Complex task requiring multiple steps and AI reasoning
